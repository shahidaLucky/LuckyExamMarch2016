Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
JDK the Java Development Kit contains:
JRE--- (Java runtime environment it is a part of JDK a set of software tools for development of java applications).
A Interpreter/Loader--- (java virtual machine that load and run the java bytecode).
A Compiler--- (javac which compiles the source code to byte code Classnmae.class extension)
An archiver--- (jar is a package file format used to aggregate many java class files and associated metadata and resources into libraries on java platform)
A documentation genarator (javadoc)--- it is a documentation generator for java language generarting API documentation in HTML format from java source code.

What is IDE?
Integrated Development Environment is a software application which enables users to write and debug Java programs.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Eclipse, Intellij, BlueJ, Netbeans, JCreator.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
From the editor source code goes to java compiler (javac) which compiles the source code to byte code Classname.class and the
JVM(java virtual machine) load the class verify the bytecode and convert it into machine language finally it goes to OS to display the output.

what is class?
Class is the blue print of an object . Class is a definition of objects of the same kind.
In other hand design or Architecture to build anything

What is object?
Object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
Main method is the entry point of an application example- public static void main (String [] srgs){}

Why main is static?
main is static because without creating any object we can use the method.
static keyword allows to access class properties without creating Object.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
--In Interface you cannot implement any method but in Abstract class you are allowed to implement non-abstract methods.
--Interface supports multiple inheritance and abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.
--Interface has only static and final variables but Abstract class can have final,
     non-final, static and non-static variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
no we cannot make an object from an Interface and Abstarct class.
We can extend or implement the Abstract and interface class in a new class,then create the object of this new class and then use this object.

what is Access Specifier?
Access specifier regulates the access to the classes and methods it determines whether a class or method can be used in another class or method.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming.
OOP features are as follows:
Abstraction----Abstraction means the process of forming of general and relevant concept from more complex scenarios it basically hide the information. 
Encapsulation----Encapsulation means the localization of the information or knowledge within an object.
                Encapsulation is also called as Information Hiding.
Inheritance-----This is a process by which one class acquires the properties and functionalities of another class.
Polymorphism----Polymorphism is a feature that allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.
                Polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API is Application Program Interface. It is a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software applications.
List of API:
java.io;
java.lang;
java.util;

Does java support multiple inheritance?
No java doesn't support multiple inheritance it only support multilevel inheritance.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have two or more methods having same name.
It happens in run time.

What is method overriding and when it happens?
Redefining a super class method in a sub class is called method overriding.
It happens in run time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
An exception (or exceptional event) is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
Java finally block is used to handle the exception followed by try or catch block.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class as it belongs to the type, not the actual objects themselves.
Static variable belongs to class.
When a variable is static it will no more belongs to object so whenever its value changes it effects all the objects
static keyword allows to access class properties without creating Object.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user.
If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable.
If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.

What is final, finally and finalize?
final is used to make restriction to the variables and methods.
finally is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection, stream etc.
finally block is always executed whether you are able to open a file and read a file or not or exception is handled or not.
finalize is a block of code to kill the garbage from garbage collector called finalize()method.

What is a constructor ?
The purpose of constructor is to initialize object.
The name of the constructor is same as the class name.
It does not return a value not even void

What is "this" keyword in java ?
this is a keyword in Java which can be used inside method or constructor of class.
this works as a reference to current object whose method or constructor is being invoked.
this keyword can be used to refer any member of current object from within an instance method or a constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java?
The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer immediate parent class object.

What is JVM stand for ?
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.

What version of java are you using?
Jdk 1.8.
What is JAR stand for ?
JAR stands for "Java ARchive"

What is compile time and run time?
The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become an executable program. This compilation process is referred to as compile time.
When an application is running, it is called runtime.

What is heap?
The JVM has a heap that is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays are allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
Java maintains a stack to store all object references whichever are being in use by program. Objects actually stores in memory heap and
their references are maintained on memory stack. It is done by JVM.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
The main difference are as follows:
 1) The String object is immutable in Java but StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable objects.
 2) StringBuffer is synchronized while StringBuilder is not which makes StringBuilder faster than StringBuffer.
 3) StringBuffer is less efficient than StringBuilder where StringBuilder is more efficient than StringBuffer.
 4) StringBuffer is synchronized but StringBuilder is non-synchronized.
