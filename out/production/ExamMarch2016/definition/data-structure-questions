Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Data structure is a particular way of sorting and organizing information in computer so that it can be retrieved and used most productively.
Data structures is used to manage large amounts of data efficiently such as large databases.
Data structures are used in almost every program or software system.
Thats why wee need data structure

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
List:
Compiler Design,
Operating System,
Database Management System,
Statistical analysis package,
Numerical Analysis,
Graphics,
Artificial Intelligence,
Simulation.

what is an Array?
An Array is a container that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.
The length of an array is established when the array is created.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
The main differences are:
1) An Array is static, you cannot change its length once its created,but ArrayList is dynamic,it can grow to accommodate more elements.
2) Array takes less memory than ArrayList for sorting same number of elements or objects.
3) ArrayList allows you to remove elements, but Array doesnâ€™t provide such methods.
4) Array can accommodate both primitive and objects, but ArrayList can only accommodate objects.
5) Array can be multi-dimensional but ArrayList is always one dimensional.

what is LinkedList?
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
A linked list use nodes to hold the elements. These nodes are point to each other, each node is composed of data and a reference to the next node.

what is queue?
A queue is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.
Addition takes place only at the tail,and removal takes place only at the head.

what is stack?
A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO is First in First Out.
LIFO is Last In First Out.

what is the order of complexity?
The order of complexity generally refers to the time complexity of algorithms in data structure.
Time complexity signify the total time required by a program to be completed.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
ArrayList is the best case to search an element from an array.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
The worst case to search an element from an array is LinkedList.

what is tree in data structure?
A tree is a widely used abstract data type or data structure it simulates a hierarchical tree structure.
A tree is a data structure consisting of nodes. With a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node,represented as a set of linked nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.
The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
-->The most significant different between HashTable and HashMap is that,
   HashMap is not thread-safe  while HashTable is a thread-safe collection.
-->Second important difference between HashTable and HashMap is performance,
   since HashMap is not synchronized it perform better than HashTable.
-->Third difference on HashTable and HashMap is that HashTable is obsolete class
   and you should be using ConcurrentHashMap in place of HashTable in Java.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
---->Array that means Array of structures are used in RDBMS.
---->Graph is used in Network data model.
---->Tree is used in Hierarchical data model.

How HashMap works in java?
HashMap has a inner class called Entry which stores key-value pairs.Above Entry object is stored in Entry[ ](Array) called table.
An index of table is logically known as bucket and it stores first element of linkedlist.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException is a class in java (from java.lang package).
The problem of accessing an array element beyond the size of array is represented by a class known as ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException .
It occures during runtime.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
There are several ways to copy an array:
-- By using the various copyOf and copyOfRange methods of the Arrays class.
--By using System.arraycopy - useful when copying parts of an array
--By calling its clone method, and do a cast.
--By using a for loop - more than one line, and needs a loop index.


What is difference between an array and a linked list?
The main difference are:
1) ArrayList search operation is pretty fast compared to the LinkedList search operation.
2) LinkedList element addition and deletion is faster than ArrayList.
3) ArrayList maintains indexes and element data and LinkedList maintains element data and two pointers the memory consumption is high in LinkedList.

What is DFS and BFS?
DFS stands for Depth First Search-----is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
                                      each edge either connects an ancestor to a descendant, a descendant to an ancestor,
                                      or one node to a node in a previously visited subtree.
BFS stands for Breadth First Search-- is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
                                      Each edge of the graph either connects two vertices at the same level,
                                      goes down exactly one level, or goes up any number of levels.

What is Recursion?
Recursion is a basic programming technique in which a method calls itself to solve some problem.
A method that uses this technique is recursive. Many programming problems can be solved only by recursion,
and some problems that can be solved by other techniques are better solved by recursion.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time
required or the space used by an algorithm.
